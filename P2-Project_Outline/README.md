# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview

Our app proposes to allow a logged-in user to manage their habits and various tasks for which they might need reinforcement to perform or avoid performing. The basic form of the app allows user, once they are logged in, to enter/modify/remove habits, and update whether or not they completed the task on a specific day. User will then receive negative or positive reinfocement depending on their responses.


### Features

User login
Interacting with user via emails


### Technologies

JavSacript/React
Java/Spring Boot
MySQL (Hibernate?)

### What I'll Have to Learn

Most technologies we learned to use during LC101. The new one is React, which I started learning about last week, and will definitely have to keep working. There are also specific things I will need to brush up on, like user authentication, (sending user emails is also something new actually), but I expect that there is enough online help on any of the features we are going to include in our app to be able to start building quickly.
